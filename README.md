# Metal Gear Solid Project (Year 1, Block B - BUAS)

This repository contains a ported version of my Year 1, Block B project from Breda University of Applied Sciences (BUAS). It is hosted here to share my work and serve as a resource for those interested in learning about the various technologies and concepts utilized in this project.

## Project Overview
The goal of the project was to create a Metal Gear Solid-inspired game capable of running on both:
- **Windows** (using OpenGL)
- **Raspberry Pi running Linux** (using OpenGL ES)

## Technologies Used
The following libraries and frameworks are used in this project:
- **OpenGL** (Windows)
- **OpenGL ES** (Linux)
- **Bullet Physics**
- **GLM** (Mathematics library)
- **ImGui** (GUI library)
- **STB Image** (Image loading)
- **Assimp** (Asset importing)
- **GLAD** (Windows OpenGL loader)
- **GLFW** (Windows input and windowing)
- **X11** (Linux input and windowing)
- **GLES** (Linux OpenGL ES API)
- **EGL** (Linux rendering interface)

## Important Notes
- **Unzip Everything**: Some libraries are quite large, and GitHub imposes file size limits. Ensure that you extract all files to prevent issues with missing assets or libraries.
- **Setup for Raspberry Pi**:  
  For the project to work on your Raspberry Pi, you need to run the `setup.sh` shell file.  
  **Note**: This project has only been tested on the **Bookworm** and **Bullseye** Raspberry Pi OS distributions.
